I have extensive knowledge and experience with legal contracts, such as: creating documents, translating documents, interpreting legal documents at private meetings, including with the Brazilian government, and I have worked at a law firm in Los Angeles, California (Remote) as a legal receptionist focusing 
on immigration visas for the United States.

I am a dedicated, hard-working, determined, quick learner, creative, quick problem-solver, team-oriented, kind, gentle person, and I believe in my capacity, 
Furthermore, I know there is always so much more to learn and grow both professionally and person.
